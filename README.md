- ‚úÖ Light control through clicking
- üöß Visual editor is under development
- üöß Some features may be unstable
- üöß Configuration requires manual YAML editing

## Installation

1. Download the `apartment-view-card.js` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/grozdanowski/ha-apartment-view-card/releases/latest)
2. Copy the file to your Home Assistant's `/config/www/` directory
3. Add the card to your dashboard using the "Show Code Editor" option (the visual editor is currently under development)

## Creating the Required Images

The easiest way to create the required images is using [Sweet Home 3D](http://www.sweethome3d.com/), a free interior design application. Here's how to create each image:

1. Download and install [Sweet Home 3D](http://www.sweethome3d.com/)
2. Create your apartment layout:
   - Draw the walls and rooms
   - Add furniture and fixtures
   - Place lights where you want them to be interactive
3. Create the required images:
   - `all-lights.png`: Set all lights to maximum brightness
   - `day.png`: Set lights to off and use daylight settings
   - `night.png`: Set lights to off and use night settings
   - `duskdawn.png`: Set lights to off and use sunset/sunrise settings
4. Export each view as a PNG image
5. Upload the images to your Home Assistant's `/config/www/` directory

Tips for creating good images:

- Use the same camera angle for all images
- Keep the resolution consistent
- Make sure the lighting is clearly visible
- Test the images in Home Assistant to ensure they work well together
