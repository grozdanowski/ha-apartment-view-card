# Apartment View Card

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Work in Progress**: This card is currently under active development. Some features may not work as expected, and the configuration interface is still being improved. Please report any issues you encounter.

A Home Assistant card that shows your apartment layout with interactive lights. The card displays different images based on the time of day and allows you to control your lights by clicking on their positions in the layout.

## Time of Day Behavior

The card automatically switches between different views based on the time of day to create a realistic representation of your apartment:

- **Day View**: Shows your apartment in natural daylight, typically from sunrise until late afternoon
- **Dusk/Dawn View**: Displays a warm, ambient lighting during sunrise and sunset hours
- **Night View**: Shows your apartment in darkness, typically from late evening until early morning

The transitions between these views are smooth and automatic, creating a natural flow throughout the day. The card uses Home Assistant's sun position to determine the appropriate view, ensuring accurate representation of your local daylight conditions.

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ Basic functionality works
- ‚úÖ Day/night image switching
- ‚úÖ Light control through clicking
- üöß Visual editor is under development
- üöß Some features may be unstable
- üöß Configuration requires manual YAML editing

## Installation

1. Download the `apartment-view-card.js` file
2. Copy the file to your Home Assistant's `/config/www/` directory
3. Add the card to your configuration:

Example of adding to `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
frontend:
  themes: !include_dir_merge_named themes
  extra_module_url:
    - /hacsfiles/lovelace-card-mod/card-mod.js
    - /local/apartment-view-card.js
```

## Creating the Required Images

The easiest way to create the required images is using [Sweet Home 3D](http://www.sweethome3d.com/), a free interior design application. Here's how to create each image:

1. Download and install [Sweet Home 3D](http://www.sweethome3d.com/)
2. Create your apartment layout:
   - Draw the walls and rooms
   - Add furniture and fixtures
   - Place lights where you want them to be interactive
3. Create the required images:
   - `all-lights.png`: Set all lights to maximum brightness
   - `day.png`: Set lights to off and use daylight settings
   - `night.png`: Set lights to off and use night settings
   - `duskdawn.png`: Set lights to off and use sunset/sunrise settings
4. Export each view as a PNG image
5. Upload the images to your Home Assistant's `/config/www/` directory

Tips for creating good images:

- Use the same camera angle for all images
- Keep the resolution consistent
- Make sure the lighting is clearly visible
- Test the images in Home Assistant to ensure they work well together

## Configuration
